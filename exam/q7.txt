The main problems of q7 are
Switch Statements
Switch statements include not only Switch-related statements, but also multi-layer if...else statements.
The problem with switch statements is repetition, if you add a new case statement to it, you have to find
all the switch statements and modify them.

Duplicated Code
Duplicated codes are located in different locations and have the same program structure. Duplicated codes are
difficult to maintain. If you want to modify the code logic of one section, you need to modify it multiple times,
and omissions are likely to occur.

Solution:
1. Use polymorphism to create different Response inheritance EntityInfoResponse,
and return different Response for different types of data
2. Separate deviceList and satelliteList into two different pair methods
