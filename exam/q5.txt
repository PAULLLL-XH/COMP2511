a. purely incremental design
b. To obtain good results it's needed proper planning and designing skills. Lack of skills will lead to
gain losses from development of software. Problems may occur due to integration between iteration.
If we draw a picture, using incremental model, we split it into serveral parts. If using big design up front, we separate it into serveral steps.
Implementing different parts need good planning and design.
